# StreamStatus
My stream overlay project, designed for my Final Fantasy 7 streaming. An unholy combination of VB, PHP, and JavaScript.
This project was originally developed to provide an interesting and eye catching overlay
for my twitch streams of Final Fantasy 7, and then turned into a first (and successful) delve
into hooking and memory reading so as to grab the data live. As of this writing (4/18/2015), the plan going forward
is to create a generic overlay system for twitch streams, potentially including a direct OBS plugin
instead of the use of browser support, as well as layout tables and tables of memory addresses for different games.
This is currently planned for future, and as of this writing the code here is best suited for streaming Final Fantasy 7.
This code can be freely distributed and modified. See the LICENSE file for details.
