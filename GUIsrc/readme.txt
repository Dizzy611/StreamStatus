As far as these two directories go, StreamStatus is the older GUI,
which merely generates an XML file based on manual input. It is kept
here mainly for reference and for historical interest. StreamStatusNG
is the live development branch of the GUI, which will house new
development, including eventual multi-game support.

The current version of the imagegen.php image generator will not
work with the older StreamStatus GUI unmodified, as the XML format
has changed slightly.
